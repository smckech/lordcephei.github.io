{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

Each element of data follows a **token**{: style="color: blue"}. The **token**{: style="color: blue"} tells the reader what the data signifies.  

Each token belongs to a category. **VERS**{: style="color: red"}, **ITER**{: style="color: red"}, **BZ**{: style="color: red"}, **STRUC**{: style="color: red"}, **SPEC**{: style="color: red"}, **SITE**{: style="color: red"} are categories that organize the input by topic.  
Any text that begins in the first column is a category.  

Thus the full identifier consists of a sequence of tags, e.g. **BZ**{: style="color: red"}\_**METAL**{: style="color: blue"}, whose components are stuctured like a tree.  

Sometimes the identifier has three tags, e.g. **HAM**{: style="color: red"}\_**AUTOBAS**{: style="color: green"}\_**LOC**{: style="color: blue"}. The leading tag is the **category**{: style="color: red"}; the last is the **token**{: style="color: blue"}.  

##### _Tags, Categories and Tokens_

The input file offers a very flexible free format: tags identify data to be read by a program, e.g.

        W=.01

reads a parameter (.01) from tag W.  

Tags are organized in a tree structure: a tag connected to the trunk of the tree is called a **category**{: style="color: red"}. A category holds information for a family of data, for example **BZ**{: style="color: red"} contains parameters associated with Brillouin zone integration. The entire input system has at present a grand total of 17 categories, though any one program uses only a subset of them.  

A tag in the outermost branch of the tree points to actual data and is called a **token**{: style="color: blue"}. Each category contains a collection of tags within it −− usually tokens, but sometimes an intermediate tag which contains a collection of tokens within it, as described below.  

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('tagexample'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">Click here for an example.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:25px;" id="tagexample">{:/} 

Suppose for example, the calculation you want to do requires Brillouin zone integrations of a metallic material, which you plan to to carry out using the Methfessel-Paxton sampling method.  Two parameters: polynomial order n and gaussian width w. 
Two tags are used to identify them: internally they are represented as **BZ\_N** and **BZ_W**, but in the input file they are usually expressed as follows: 

        BZ	N=2	W=.01

This format style is the most commonly used because it is clean and easy to read; but it conceals the tree structure a little. The same data can equally be written:

        BZ[	N=2 	W=.01]

Now the tree structure is apparent: [..] delimits the scope of tag **BZ**.  

The root tag, or category, is BZ in this case. Any tag that starts in the first column is a category. Thus any non-white character appearing in the first column automatically starts a new category, and also terminates any prior category, if it hasn’t been terminated already. N= and W= mark tokens **BZ_N** and **BZ_W**.  

Apart from the special use of the first column to identify categories, data is free-format, apart from a few mild exceptions. Thus:

        BZ      N=2
                W=.01
        BZ	W=.01	N=2
        BZ[	W=.01	N=2]

all represent the same information.  

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} if two categories appear in an input file, only the first is used. Subsequent categories are ignored. Generally, only the first tag is used when more than one appears within a given scope.

{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

Usually the tag tree has only two levels (category and token) but not always. For example, data associated with atomic sites must be supplied for each site. In this case the tree has three levels, e.g. **SITE_ATOM_POS**. Site data is typically represented in a format along the following lines:

        SITE    ATOM=Ga  POS=  0   0   0    RELAX=T
                ATOM=As  POS= .25 .25 .25
                ATOM=...
                ...
        END

The scope of  **SITE**  starts at "SITE"  and terminates just before "END". There will be multiple instances of the  **SITE_ATOM**  tag, one for each site. The scope of the first instance begins with the first occurrence of  ATOM  and terminates just before the second: 

        ATOM=Ga  POS=  0   0   0    RELAX=T 

And the scope of the second **SITE_ATOM** is 

        ATOM=As  POS= .25 .25 .25 

Note that **ATOM** simultaneously acts like a token pointing to data (e.g. Ga) and as a tag holding tokens within it, in this case **SITE_ATOM_POS** and (for the first site) **SITE_ATOM_RELAX**.  

Some tags are required; others are optional; still others (in fact most) may not be used at all by a particular program. If a code needs site data, **SITE_ATOM_POS** is required, but **SITE_ATOM_RELAX** is probably optional, or not read at all.  

##### _Preprocessor_

Input lines are passed through a preprocessor, which provides a wide flexibility in how input files are structured. The preprocessor has many features in common with a programming language, including the ability to declare variables, evaluate algebraic expressions; and it has constructs for branching and looping, to make possible multiple or conditional reading of input lines.  

For example, supposing through a prior preprocessor instruction you have declared a variable *range*, and it has been assigned the value 3. This line in the input file:

        RMAX={range+1/4}

is parsed and turned in to:

        RMAX=3.25
 
The preprocessor treats text inside brackets {...} as an expression (usually an algebraic expression), which is evaluated and rendered back as an ASCII string.  

The preprocessor’s programming language makes it possible for a single file to serve as input for many materials systems in the manner of a database; or as documentation. Also you can easily vary input conditions in a parameteric fashion.  

Many files other than  `ctrl.ext‘ are first parsed by the preprocessor: files for site positions, Euler angles for noncollinear magnetism, among others.  

### _Input Methods: Command Line Arguments_

Command-line arguments allow for a second, very convenient input stream. In particular you can use them to declare and assign values to variables which can modify the input file via the preprocessor. A number of other directives are also possible. Here is an example:

         lmchk -vns=4 -vnm=5 --wpos=pos ... 

lmchk reads site positions, checks for augmentation sphere overlaps, and can print out a wealth of other structural data.  

The switches tell lmchk to create variables  ns  and  nm  (assigning values 4 and 5 respectively), and includes an instruction to dump site positions to file  pos.ext.  

Following unix style, switches always begin with `−‘. There are many command-line arguments that are specific to a particular executable; here are some generic command-line switches common to most or all programs described.  

Some switches have a single "−"; some have two ("−−"). Those with a single "−" tend to have an "assignment" function, such as a variables declaration (eg −vx=3), while those with two tend to control program flow (eg. −−wpos=name). Sometimes there is not a clear distinction , e.g. −−pr and −pr  perform the same function, namely setting the output verbosity via the command line.  

You can also put these switches in the  CMD  category in the input file. The function is similar to a command-line argument, but not identical, since preprocessor has already read the input file before the "CMD" switches are read. Thus the  "−v"  and  "−c"  variable declarations have no effect.  

Some switches are common to most or all programs.  
<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('commonSwitch'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">Click to show common switches.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:25px;" id="commonSwitch">{:/} 

        --h                     lists switches for that program and quits
                                (warning: sometimes documentation is slightly out of date)

        --input                 same as turning on HELP=T in category IO; see HELP= above.

        --show                  same as turning on SHOW=T in category IO; see SHOW= above.

        --showp                 prints out input file after having run through the
                                preprocessor, and exits.

        --pr#1[,#2]             sets print verbosities.  #2 is verbosity for generation
         -pr#1[,#2]             of the potential, and assumes the value of #1 unless specified.

        --time=#1[,#2]          prints out a summary of timings in various branches of
                                the code at the close of program execution.  Timings
                                are kept to a nesting level of #1.  If #2 is
                                nonzero, timings are printed 'on the fly'

        --iactive               turns on 'interactive' mode.  User is queried at
                                various points, such as whether to continue iterations.
                                You can specify this in ctrl file 'IO IACTIV='
        --no-iactive            turns off 'interactive' mode

        -v"name=expr"           declares a numeric variable and assigns to the value of
                                expression `expr'. Be advised that only the first
                                declaration of a variable is used.  Later declarations
                                have no effect.  In addition to the declaration
                                `name=...'  there are assignment operators
                                '*=','/=','+=','-=','^=' modify existing variables,
                                following C syntax, as described in the preprocessor documentation.

        -c"name=strn"           declares a character variable and assigns to value `strn'

        --rpos=filnam           After reading input file, read site positions from "filnam"

        --fixpos[:tol=#]        Adjust positions slightly, rendering them as
                                exactly as possible consistent with the symmetry group

### _Input File Categories_
_____________________________________________________________
This section details the various categories and tokens used in the input file.

##### _Preliminaries_
_Note:_{: style="color: red"} The tables below list the input systems’ tokens and their function. Tables are organized by category.

*   The Arguments column refers to the cast belonging to the token ("l", "i", "r", and "c" refer to logical, integer, floating-point and character data, respectively)
*   The Program column indicates which programs the token is specific to, if any
*   The Optional column indicates whether the token is optional (Y) or required (N)
*   The Default column indicates the default value, if any
*   The Explanation column describes the token’s function.

##### _BZ_
Category BZ holds information concerning the numerical integration of quantities such as energy bands over the Brillouin Zone (BZ). The LMTO programs permit both sampling and tetrahedron integration methods. Both are described in bzintegration.html, and the relative merits of the two different methods are discussed. As implemented both methods use a uniform, regularly spaced mesh of k-points, which divides the BZ into microcells as described here. Normally you specify this mesh by the number of divisions of each of the three primitive reciprocal lattice vectors (which are the inverse, transpose of the lattice vectors PLAT); NKABC below.

These tokens are read by programs that make hamiltonians in periodic crystals (lmf,lm,lmgf,lmpg,tbe). Some tokens apply only to codes that make energy bands, (lmf,lm,tbe).

Token | Arguments | Program | Optional | Default | Explanation
- | - | - | - | - | - 
GETQP | l | | Y | F | Read list of k-points from a disk file. This is a special mode, and you normally would let the program choose its own mesh by specifying the number of divisions (see NKABC). <br> If token is not parsed, the program will attempt to parse NKABC.
NKABC | l to 3 i | | N | | The number of divisions in the three directions of the reciprocal lattice vectors. k-points are generated along a uniform mesh on each of these axes. (This is the optimal general purpose quadrature for periodic functions as it integrates the largest number of sine and cosine functions exactly for a specified number of points.) <br><br> The parser will attempt to read three integers. If only one number is read, the missing second and third entries assume the value of the first. <br><br> Information from NKABC, together with BZJOB below, contains specifications equivalent to the widely used “Monkhorst Pack” scheme. But it is more transparent and easier to understand. The number of k-points in the full BZ is the product of these numbers; the number of irreducible k-points may be reduced by symmetry operations.
PUTQP | l | | Y | F | If T, Write out the list of irreducible k-points to file qpts, and the weights for tetrahedron integration if available.
BZJOB | l to 3 i | | Y | 0 | Controls the centering of the k-points in the BZ: <br>0: the mesh is centered so that one point lies at the origin <br>1: points symmetrically straddle the origin <br><br>Three numbers are supplied, corresponding to each of the three primitive reciprocal lattice vectors. As with NKABC if only one number is read the missing second and third entries assume the value of the first.
METAL | i | lmf, lm, tbe | Y | 1 | Specifies how the weights are generated for BZ integration. <br><br>Numerical quadrature is used to to accumulate the output density or any BZ-integrated property.<br>In insulators, each point in the full BZ gets equal weight; in metals, the weights depend on the Fermi level $$ E_F $$, which must be determined from the eigenvalues. <br>There are these possibilities: {::nomarkdown} <ul><li>either the weights for each k are known in advance, as is the case for insulators;</li><li>{:/} $$ E_F $$ {::nomarkdown}must be determined before BZ integrations are performed (tetrahedron integration).<br><br>In this more difficult case, there are two possibilities:<ul><li>the weight at k does not depend on values of neighboring k (the case for Methfessel-Paxton sampling integration)</li><li>the weight at k does depend on values of neighboring k (tetrahedron integration). </li></ul></li></ul><br> The first case is easy to handle. For the latter several strategies have been developed.<br>The METAL token accepts the following:<ul><li>System assumed to be an insulator; weights determined a priori.</li><li>Eigenvectors are written to disk, in which case the integration for the charge density can be deferred until all the bands are obtained. This option is available only for the ASA:<br>When accumulating just the spherical part of the charge, eigenvector data can be contracted over m, reducing memory demands.</li><li>Integration weights are read from file wkp.ext, would have been generated in a prior band pass. If wkp.ext is missing or unsuitable, the program will temporarily switch to METAL=3.</li><li>Two band passes are made; the first generates only eigenvalues to determine {:/} $$ E_F $$ {::nomarkdown}. It is slower than METAL=2, but it is more stable which can be important in difficult cases.</li><li>Three distinct Fermi levels are assumed and weights generated for each. After {:/} $$ E_F $$ {::nomarkdown} is determined, the actual weights are calculated by quadratic interpolation through the three points. The three Fermi levels are gradually narrowed to a small window around the true {:/} $$ E_F $$ {::nomarkdown} in the course of the self-consistency cycle.<br>This scheme works for sampling integration where the k-point weights depend on {:/} $$ E_F $$ {::nomarkdown} only and not eigenvalues at neighboring k.<br>You can also use this scheme in a mixed tetrahedron/sampling method:<br>Weights for the band sum are determined by tetrahedron, but the charge density is integrated by sampling.<br>It works better than straight sampling because the total energy is variational in the density.</li><li>like METAL=3 in that two passes are made but eigenvectors are kept in memory so there is no additional overhead in the first pass.<br>This is the recommended mode for lmf unless you are working with a large system and need to conserve memory.</li></ul>{:/}<br>The ASA code lm implements METAL=0,1,2; the FP lmf implements METAL=0,2,3,4,5.
TETRA | 1 | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | T | Selects BZ integration method<br>0: Methfessel-Paxton sampling integration. Tokens NPTS, N, W, EF0, DELEF (see below) are relevant to this integration scheme.<br>1: tetrahedron integration, with Bloechl weights
N | i | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 0 | Polynomial order for sampling integration; see Methfessel and Paxton, Phys. Rev. B, 40, 3616 (1989). (Not used with tetrahedron integration or for insulators)<br><br>0: integration uses standard gaussian method<br><br>>0: integration uses generalized gaussian functions, i.e. polynomial of order N * gaussian to generate integration weights<br><br>−1: use the Fermi function rather than gaussians to broaden the δ-function. This generates the actual electron (fermi) distribution for a finite temperature.<br><br>100: By default, if a gap is found separating occupied and occupied states, the program will treat the system as and insulator, even when MET>0. To suppress this, add 100 to N (use −101 for Fermi distribution).
W | r | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 5e-3 | {::nomarkdown} <ul><li>Case BZ_N\>0:<br>Broadening (Gaussian width) for Gaussian sampling integration (Ry).</li><li>Case BZ_N\<0:<br>temperature, in Ry. (the sampling weights are computed from the Fermi function instead of the error function).</li></ul>{:/}<br>Not used with tetrahedron integration or for insulators.
EF0 | r | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 0 | Initial guess at Fermi energy. Used with BZ_METAL=4.
DELEF | r | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 0.05 | Initial uncertainty in Fermi level for sampling integration.<br>Used with BZ_METAL=4.
ZBAK | r | lmf,lm | Y | 0 | Homogeneous background charge
SAVDOS | i | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 0 | {::nomarkdown} <ul><li>0: does not save dos on disk</li><li>1: writes the total density of states on NPTS mesh points to disk file dos.ext.</li><li>2: Write weights to disk for partial DOS (In the ASA this occurs automatically).</li><li>4: Same as (2), but write weights m-resolved.</li></ul>{:/}You may also cause lm or lmf to generate m-resolved dos using the –pdos command-line argument.<br>NB: you must turn OFF all symmetry operations to produce correct results. (The extra inversion symmetry in the k-points from time-reversal symmetry is still allowed.)<br><br>Note:<br>SAVDOS>0 requires BZ_NPTS and BZ_DOS also.
DOS | 2 r | | Y | -1,0 | Energy window over which DOS accumulated. Needed either for sampling integration or if SAVDOS>0.
NPTS | i | | Y | 1001 | Number of points in the density-of-states mesh used in conjunction with sampling integration. Needed either for sampling integration or if SAVDOS>0.
EFMAX | r | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 2 | Only eigenvectors whose eigenvalues are less than EFMAX are computed; this improves execution efficiency.
NEVMX | i | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | 0 | \>0 : Find at most NEVMX eigenvectors<br>=0 : program uses internal default<br>\<0 : no eigenvectors are generated (and correspondingly, nothing associated with eigenvectors such as density.)<br><br>Caution: if you want to look at partial DOS well above the Fermi level (which comes out around 0), you must set EFMAX and NEVMX high enough to encompass the range of interest.
ZVAL | r | | Y | 0 | Number of electrons to accumulate in BZ integration. Normally zval is computed by the program.
NOINV | l | lmf,lm,tbe | Y | F | Suppress the automatic addition of the inversion to the list of point group operations. Usually the inversion symmetry can be included in the determination of the irreducible part of the BZ because of time reversal symmetry. There may be cases where this symmetry is broken:<br>e.g. when spin-orbit coupling is included or when the (beyond LDA) self-energy breaks time-reversal symmetry. In most cases, the program will automatically disable this addition in cases that it knows the symmetry is broken.
FSMOM | 2 r | lmf,lm | Y | 0 0 | Set the global magnetic moment (collinear magnetic case). In the fixed-spin moment method, a spin-dependent potential shift Beff is added to constrain the total magnetic moment to value assigned by FSMOM=. No constraint is imposed if this value is zero (the default).<br>Optional second arg supplies an initial Beff. It is applied whether or not the first argument is 0. If arg#1 ≠ 0, Beff is made consistent with it.
DMAT | l | lmf,lmgf | Y | F | Calculate the density matrix.
INVIT | l | lmf,lm | Y | F | Enables inverse iteration generate eigenvectors (this is the default). It is more efficient than the QL method, but occasionally fails to find all the vectors. When this happens, the program stops with the message:<br> DIAGNO: tinvit cannot find all evecs<br>If you encounter this message set INVIT=F.
EMESH | r | lmgf,lmpg | Y | 10,0,-1,... | Parameters defining contour integration for Green’s function methods.<br><br>Element: {::nomarkdown} <ol><li>number of energy points n</li><li>contour type:<ul><li>0: Uniform mesh of nz points: Real part of energy z between emin and emax</li><li>1: Same as 0, but reverse sign of Im z</li><li>10: elliptical contour</li><li>11: same as 10, but reverse sign of Im z</li><li>100s digit used for special modifications</li><li>Add 100 for nonequil part using Im(z)=delne</li><li>Add 200 for nonequil part using Im(z)=del00</li><li>Add 300 for mixed elliptical contour + real axis to find fermi level</li><li>Add 1000 to set nonequil part only.</li></ul></li><li>lower bound for energy contour emin (on the real axis)</li><li>upper bound for energy contour emax, e.g. Fermi level (on the real axis)</li><li>(elliptical contour) eccentricity: ranges between 0 (circle) and 1 (line)<br>(uniform contour) Im z</li><li>(elliptical contour) bunching parameter eps : ranges between 0 (distributed symmetrically) and 1 (bunched toward emax)<br>(uniform contour) not used</li><li>(nonequilibrium GF, lmpg) nzne = number of points on nonequilibrium contour</li><li>(nonequilibrium GF, lmpg) vne = difference in fermi energies of right and left leads</li><li>(nonequilibrium GF, lmpg) delne = Im part of E for nonequilibrium contour</li><li>(nonequilibrium GF, lmpg) substitutes for delne when making the surface self-energy.</li></ol> {:/}
MULL | i | tbe | Y | 0 | Mulliken population analysis. Mulliken population analysis is also implemented in lmf, but you specify the analysis with a command-line argument.

##### _CONST_

Category CONST enables the user to declare variables for use in algebraic expressions. The syntax is a string of declarations inside the category, e.g:

        CONST   a=10.69 nspec=4+2

Variables declared this way are similar to, but distinct from variables declared for the preprocessor, such as 

        % const nbas=5

In the latter case the preprocessor makes a pass, and may use expressions involving variables declared by e.g. "% const nbas=5" to alter the structure of the input file.  

Variables declared for use by the preprocessor lose their definition after
the preprocessor completes.  

The following code segment illustrates both types:

~~~
% const nbas=5
CONST   a=10.69 nspec=4
SPEC    ALAT=a  NSPEC=nspec NBAS={nbas}
~~~

After the preprocessor compiles, the input file appears as:

~~~
CONST   a=10.69 nspec=4
SPEC    ALAT=a  NSPEC=nspec NBAS=5
~~~

When the CONST category is read (it is read before other categories),
variables a and nspec are defined and used in the SPEC category.

##### _DYN_
Contains parameters for molecular statics and dynamics.

GMAX | r | lmf, lmfgwd | N | | G-vector cutoff used to create the mesh for the interstitial density. A uniform mesh is with spacing between points in the three directions as homogeneous as possible, with G vectors |G| < GMAX.<br>This input is required; but you may omit it if you supply information with the FTMESH token.
FTMESH | i1 [i2 i3] | FP | N | | The number of divisions specifying the uniform mesh density along the three reciprocal lattice vectors. The second and third arguments default to the value of the first one, if they are not specified. <br>This input is used only in the parser failed to read the GMAX token.
TOL | r | FP | Y | 1e-6 | Specifies the precision to which the generalized LMTO envelope functions are expanded in a Fourier expansion of G vectors.
FRZWF | l | FP | Y | F | Set to T to freeze the shape of the augmented part of the wave functions. Normally their shape is updated as the potential changes, but with FRZWF=t the potential used to make augmentation wave functions is frozen at what is read from the restart file (or free-atom potential if starting from superposing free atoms).<br>This is not normally necessary, and freezing wave functions makes the basis slightly less accurate. However, there are slight inconsistencies when these orbitals are allowed to change shape. Notably the calculated forces to not take this shape change into account, and they will be slightly inconsistent with the total energy.
FORCES | i | FP | Y | 0 | Controls how forces are to be calculated, and how the second-order corrections are to be evaluated. Through the variational principle, the total energy is correct to second order in deviations from self-consistency, but forces are correct only to first order. To obtain forces to second order, it is necessary to know how the density would change with a (virtual) displacement of the core+nucleus, which requires a linear response treatment.<br>lmf estimates this changes in one of two ways:{::nomarkdown}<ol><li>the free-atom density is subtracted from the total density for nuclei centered at the original position and added back again at the (virtually) displaced position.<br><br>For this ansatz, use FORCES=1.</li>the core+nucleus is shifted and screened assuming a Lindhard dielectric response. <br><br>For this ansatz, use FORCES=12. You also must specify ELIND, below.</li></ol>{:/}
ELIND | r | lmf | Y | -1 | a parameter in the Lindhard response function, (the Fermi level for a free-electron gas relative to the bottom of the band). You can specify this energy directly, by using a positive number for the parameter. If you use instead a negative number, the program will choose a default value from the total number of valence electrons and assuming a free-electron gas, scale that default by the absolute value of the number you specify. If you have a simple sp bonded system, the default value is a good choice. If you have d or f electrons, it tends to overestimate the response.<br>Use something smaller, e.g. ELIND=-0.7.<br><br>ELIND is used in three contexts:<br><br>(1) in the force correction term; see FORCES= above<br>(2) to estimate a self-consistent density from the input and output densities after a band pass<br>(3) to estimate a reasonable smooth density from a starting density after atoms are moved in a relaxation step.
SIGP[...] | r | lmf, lmfgwd | Y | | Parameters used to interpolate the self-energy Σ. Used in conjunction with the GW package. See gw.html for description. Default: not used
SIGP\_MODE | r | lmf, lmfgwd | Y | 4 | Specifies the linear function used for matrix elements of Σ at highly-lying energies. With recent implementations of the GW package 4 is recommended; it requires no input from you.
SIGP\_EMAX SIGP\_NMAX SIGP\_EMIN SIGP\_NMIN SIGP\_A SIGP\_B | r | lmf, lmfgwd | Y | | See gw.html
AUTOBAS[...] | r | lmfa, lmf, lmfgwd | Y | | Parameters associated with the automatic determination of the basis set.<br>These switches greatly simplify the creation of an input file for lmf.<br>Note: Programs lmfa and lmf both use tokens in the AUTOBAS tag but they mean different things, as described below. This is because lmfa generates the parameters while lmf uses them.<br><br>Default: not used
AUTOBAS\_GW | i | lmfa | Y | 0 | Set to 1 to tailor the autogenerated basis set file basp0.ext to a somewhat larger basis, better suited for GW.
AUTOBAS\_GW | i | lmf | Y | 0 | Set to 1 to float log derivatives P a bit more conservatively — better suited to GW calculations.
AUTOBAS\_LMTO | i | lmfa | Y | 0 | lmfa autogenerates a trial basis set, saving the result into basp0.ext.<br>LMTO is used in an algorithm to determine how large a basis it should construct: the number of orbitals increases as you increase LMTO.

MTO controls whether the LMTO basis is 1-κ or 2-κ, meaning whether 1 or 2 envelope functions are allowed per l channel.
AUTOBAS\_MTO | i | lmfa | Y | 0 | Autogenerate parameters that control which LMTO basis functions are to be included, and their shape.<br><br>Tokens RSMH,EH (and possibly RSMH2,EH2) determine the shape of the MTO basis. lmfa will determine a reasonable set of RSMH,EH automatically (and RSMH2,EH2 for a 2-κ basis), fitting to radial wave functions of the free atom.<br><br>Note: lmfa can generate parameters and write them to file basp0.ext.<br>lmf can read parameters from basp.ext.<br>You must manually create basp.ext, e.g. by copying basp0.ext into basp.ext.

##### _SITE_
Category SITE holds site information. As in the SPEC category, tokens must read for each site entry, and a similar restriction applies as to the order of tokens. Token ATOM= must be the first token for each site, and all tokens defining parameters for that site must occur before a subsequent ATOM=.

FILE | c | all | Y | | Provides a mechanism to read site data from a separate file. File subs/iosite.f documents the syntax of the site file structure.<br>The reccommended (standard) format has the following syntax:<br><br>The first line should contain a ‘%’ in the first column, and a `version’ token vn=#.<br>Structural data (see category STRUC documentation) may also be put this line. Each subsequent line supplies input for one site. In the simplest format, a line would would have the following:<br>spid x y z<br>where spid is the species identifier (same information would otherwise be specified by token ATOM= below) and x y z are the site positions.<br><br>Examples: fp/test/test.fp er and fp/test/test.fp tio2<br><br>Bug: when you read site data from an alternate file, the reader doesn’t compute the reference energy.<br><br>Kotani format (documented here but no longer maintained) In this alternative format the first four lines always specify data read in the STRUC category; see FILE= in STRUC.<br>Then follow lines, one line for each site<br>ib iclass spid x y z<br>The first number is merely a basis index and should increment 1,2,3,4,… in successive lines.

ATOM | c | all | N | | Identifies the species (by label) to which this atom belongs. It is a fatal error for the species not to have been defined.
ATOM\_POS | r1 r2 r3 | all | N | | the basis vector (length 3), in dimensionless Cartesian coordinates.

##### _SPEC_
Category SPEC contains species-specific information. Because data must be read for each species, tokens are repeated (once for each species). For that reason, there is some restriction as to the order of tokens. Data for a specific species (Z=, R=, R/W=, LMX=, IDXDN= and the like described below) begins with a token ATOM=; input of tokens specific to that species must precede the next occurence of ATOM=.  

The following four species apply to the automatic sphere resizer:

SCLWSR | r | ALL | Y | 0 | SCLWSR>0 turns on the automatic sphere resizer. It defaults to 0, which turns off the resizer.<br>The 10’s digit tells the resizer how to deal with resizing empty spheres; see lmto.html.
OMAX1 | r1 r2 r3 | ALL | Y | 0.16, 0.18, 0.2 | Constrains maximum allowed values of sphere overlaps.<br>You may input up to three numbers, which correspond to atom-atom, and atom-empty-sphere, and empty-sphere-empty-sphere overlaps respectively.
OMAX2 | r1 r2 r3 | ALL | Y | 0.4, 0.45, 0.5 | Constrains maximum allowed values of sphere overlaps defined differently from OMAX1; see lmto.html.<br>Both constraints are applied.
WSRMAX | r | ALL | Y | 0 | Imposes an upper limit to any one sphere radius

{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

The following tokens are input for each species. Data sandwiched between successive
occurences of ATOM apply to one species.

Token | Arguments | Program | Optional | Default | Explanation
- | - | - | - | - | -
ATOM | c | all | N | | A character string (8 characters or fewer) that labels this species. This label is used, e.g. by the SITE category to associate a species with an atom at a given site.<br>Species are split into classes; how and when this is done depends whether you are using an ASA or full-potential implementation.<br><br>ASA-specific:<br>The species ID also names a disk file with information about that atom (potential parameters, moments, potential and some sundry other information). More precisely, species are split into classes, the program differentiates class names by appending integers to the species label. The first class associated with the species has the species label; subsequent ones have integers appended.<br><br>Example: testing/test.ovlp 3
Z | r | all | N | | Nuclear charge. Normally an integer, but Z can be a fractional number. A fractional number implies a virtual crystal approximation to an alloy with some Z intermediate between the two integers sandwiching it.
R | r | all | N | | The augmentation sphere radius, in atomic units. This is a required input for most programs:<br>choose one of R=, R/W= or R/A=. Read descriptions of the latter two below for further remarks; also see this page for a more complete discussion on the choice of sphere radii.<br><br>lmchk can find sphere radii automatically for you. Invoke lmchk with<br>–getwsr.<br>You can also rescale user-chosen radii to meet constraints with the SCLWSR token.
R/W | r | all | N | | R/W= ratio of the augmentation sphere radius to the average Wigner Seitz radius W.<br>W is the radius of a sphere such that (4πW3/3) = V/N, where V/N is the volume per atom.<br>Thus if all radii are equal with R/W=1, the sum of sphere volumes would fill space, as is usual in the ASA.<br><br>ASA-specific:<br>You must choose the radii so that the sum of sphere volumes (4π/3ΣiRi3) equals the unit cell volume V; otherwise results may become unreliable. The space-filling requirement means sphere may overlap quite a lot, particularly in open systems. If sphere overlaps get too large, (>20% or so) accuracy becomes an issue. In such a case you should add “empty spheres” to fill space. Use lmchk to print out sphere overlaps. lmchk also has an automatic empty spheres finder, which you invoke with the –findes switch; see here for a discussion.<br><br>Example: testing/test.ovlp 3<br><br>FP-specific:<br>FP results are much less sensitive to the choice of sphere radii. Strictly, the spheres should not overlap, but because of lmf‘s unique augmentation scheme, overlaps of up to 10% cause negligibly small errors as a rule.<br>(This does not apply to GW calculations!)<br>Even so, it is not advisable to let the overlaps get too large. As a general rule the L-cutoff should increase as the sphere radius increases. Also it has been found in practice that self-consistency is harder to accomplish when spheres overlap significantly.

##### _START_
Category START is specific to the ASA. It controls whether the code starts with moments P,Q or potential parameters; also the moments P,Q may be input in this category. It is read by **lm**{: style="color: blue"}, **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"}, **lmpg**{: style="color: blue"}, and **tbe**{: style="color: blue"}.

Token | Arguments | Program | Optional | Default | Explanation

BEGMOM | i | ASA | Y | 1 | when true, causes program lm to begin with moments from which potential parameters are generated. If false, the potential parameters are used and the program proceeds directly to the band calculation.
FREE | 1 | ASA | Y | F | is intended to facilitate a self-consistent free-atom calculation. When FREE is true, the program uses rmax=30 for the sphere radius rather than whatever rmax is passed to it; the boundary conditions at rmax are taken to be value=slope=0 (rmax=30 should be large enough that these boundary conditions are sufficiently close to that of a free atom.); subroutine atscpp does not calculate potential parameters or save anything to disk; and lm terminates after all the atoms have been calculated.
CNTROL | 1 | ASA | Y | F | 	When CONTRL=T, the parser attempts to read the “continuously variable principal quantum numbers” P and moments Q0,Q1,Q2 for each l channel; see P,Q below.
ATOM | c | ASA | Y | | Class label. P,Q (and possibly other data) is given by class.<br>Tokens following a class label and preceding the next class label belong to that class.
ATOM\_P= and ATOM\_Q | c | ASA | Y | | Read “continuously variable principal quantum numbers” for this class (P=...), or energy moments Q0,Q1,Q2 (Q=...). P consists of one number per l channel, Q of three numbers (Q0,Q1,Q2) for each l.<br><br>Note In spin<br> polarized calculations, a second set of parameters must follow the first, and the moments should all be half of what they are in non-spin polarized calculations.<br><br>In this sample input file for Si, P,Q is given as:<br<br>>ATOM=SI  P=3.5 3.5 3.5    Q=1 0 0    2 0 0   0 0 0<br>ATOM=ES  P=1.5 2.5 3.5    Q=.5 0 0  .5 0 0   0 0 0<br><br>One electron is put in the Si s orbital, 2 in the p and none in the d, while 0.5 electrons are put in the s and p channels for the empty sphere. All first and second moments are zero. This rough guess produces a correspondingly rough potential.<br><br>You do not have to supply information here for every class; but for classes you do, you must supply all of (P,Q0,Q1,Q2). Data read in START supersedes whatever may have read from disk.<br><br>Remarks below provide further information about how P,Q is read and printed.
RDVES | 1 | ASA | Y | F | Read Ves(RMT) from the START category along with P,Q
ATOM\_ENU | r | ASA | Y | | Linearization energies

How the parser reads P,Q
Remember that knowledge of P,Q is sufficient to completely determine the ASA density.
Thus the ASA codes use several ways to read these important quantities.

The parser returns P,Q according the following priorities:

* P,Q are read from the disk, if supplied, (along possibly with other quantities such as potential parameters El, C, Δ, γ.) One file is created for each class that contains this data and other class-specific information. Some or all of the data may be missing from the disk files. Alternatively, you may read these data from a restart file rsta.ext, which if it exists contains data for all classes in one file. The program will not read this data by default; use --rs=1 to have it read from the rsta file. To write class data to rsta, use --rs=*,1 (* must be be 0 or 1)

* If START_CONTRL=T, P,Q (and possibly other quantities) are read from START for classes you supply (usually all classes). Data read from this category supersedes any that might have been read from disk. If class data read from either of these sources, the input system returns it. For classes where none is available the parser will pick a default:

  * If data from a different class but in the same species is available, use it.
  
  * Otherwise use some preset default values for P,Q.

After a calculation finishes you can run **lmctl**{: style="color: blue"} to read P,Q from disk and format it in a form ready to insert into the START category. Thus all the information needed to generate a self-consistent ASA calculation can be contained in the ctrl file.

When the sample Si test is run to self-consistency, invoking **lmctl**{: style="color: blue"} will generate something like:

~~~
ATOM=SI       P=  3.8303101  3.7074067  3.2545634
              Q=  1.1694276  0.0000000  0.0297168
                  1.8803181  0.0000000  0.0489234
                  0.1742629  0.0000000  0.0063520
ATOM=ES       P=  1.4162942  2.2521617  3.1546386
              Q=  0.2873686  0.0000000  0.0129888
                  0.3485430  0.0000000  0.0165416
                  0.1400664  0.0000000  0.0055459
~~~

Because the P‘s float to the band center-of gravity (i.e. center of gravity of the occupied states for a particular site and l channel) the corresponding first moments Q1 vanish. P‘s are floated by default since it minimizes the linearization error.

**Caution:**{: style="color: red"} Sometimes it is necessary to override this default: If the band CG (of the occupied states) is far removed from the natural CG of a particular channel, you must restrict how far P can be shifted to the band CG. In some cases, allowing P to float completely will result in “ghost bands”.

The high-lying Ga 4d state is a classic example. To restrict P to a fixed value, see SPEC_IDMOD.

In such cases, you want to pick P low, but not so low as to cause problems.

##### _SYMGRP_

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('symtable'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';"><button type="button" class="button tiny radius">Click to show SYMGRP.</button></div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;margin:0px 25px 0px 25px;"id="symtable">{:/}

Category SYMGRP provides symmetry information; it helps in two ways. First it is the relevant information to find which sites are equivalent, which makes for simpler and more accurate band calculations, and second, it reduces the number of k-points needed in Brillouin zone integrations.  

Normally you don't need SYMGRP; the program is capable of finding its own symmetry operations. However, there are cases where it is useful or even necessary to manually specify them. For example when including spin-orbit coupling or noncollinear magnetism where the symmetry group isn't only specified by the atomic positions. In this case you need to supply extra information.  

You can use SYMGRP to explicitly declare a set of generators from which the entire group can be created. For example, the three operations R4X, MX and R3D are sufficient to generate all 48 elements of cubic symmetry.  

Unless conditions are set for noncollinear magnetism and/or SO coupling, the inversion is assumed by default as a consequence of time-reversal symmetry.  

A tag describing a generator for a point group operation has the form O(nx,ny,nz) where O is one of M, I or Rj, or E, for mirror, inversion j-fold rotation and identity operation, respectively. nx,ny,nz are a triplet of indices specifying the axis of rotation. You may use X, Y, Z or D as shorthand for (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and (1,1,1) respectively. You may also enter products of rotations, such as I*R4X.

Thus

    SYMGRP  R4X MX R3D

specifies three generators (4-fold rotation around x, mirror in x, 3-fold rotation around (1,1,1)). Generating all possible combinations of these rotations will result in the 48 symmetry operations of the cube.  

To suppress all symmetry operations, use

    SYMGRP E

Full-potential programs (e.g. lmf) do not make spherical approximations to the potential and require you to specify the full space group. The translation part is appended to the point group (rotation) in one of the following forms: ':(x1,x2,x3)' or alternatively '::(p1,p2,p3)' with the double '::'. The first defines the translation in Cartesian coordinates; the second as multiples of plat. These two lines (taken from testing/ctrl.cr3si6) are equivalent specifications:

    SYMGRP   r6z:(0,0,0.4778973) r2(1/2,sqrt(3)/2,0)
	SYMGRP   r6z::(0,0,1/3)      r2(1/2,sqrt(3)/2,0)

###### _Keywords in the SYMGRP category_
SYMGRP accepts, in addition to symmetry operations the following keywords:

* `find‘ tells the program to determine its own symmetry operations. Thus:

      SYMGRP find
  
  amounts to the same as not incuding a SYMGRP category in the input at all  
   
  You can also specify a mix of generators you supply, and tell the program to find any others that might exist. For example:
  
      SYMGRP r4x find
 
  specifies that 4-fold rotation be included, and `find‘ tells the program to look for any additional symops that might exist.
  
* 'AFM':
  For certain antiferromagnets, certain translation operations exist provided the rotation/shift is accompanied by a spin flip. Say a translation of (-1/2,1/2,1/2)a restores the crystal structure, but all atoms after translation have opposite spin. Specify this symmetry with:
  
      SYMGRP   ...       AFM::-1/2,1/2,1/2

  This operation is used only by **lmf**{: style="color: blue"}.
  
* 'SOC' or 'SOC=2':
  Tells the symmetry group generator to exclude operations that do not preserve the z axis.  
  This is used particularly for spin-orbit coupling where the crystal symmetry is reduced (z is the quantization axis).
  SOC=2 is like SOC but allows operations that preserve z or flip z to −z.
  This works in some cases.  

  **Note:**{: style="color: red"} This keyword is only active when the two spin channels are linked, e.g. SO coupling or noncollinear magnetism.
  
* 'GRP2' turns on a switch that can force the density among inequivalent classes that share a common species to be averaged. In the ASA codes the density is spherical and the averaging is complete; in the FP case only the spherical part of the densities can be averaged. This helps sometimes with stabilizing difficult cases in the path to self-consistency.
  You specify which species are to be averaged with the SPEC_ATOM_GRP2 token.  
  
  'GRP2‘ averages the input density;
  'GRP2=2‘ averages the output density;
  'GRP2=3‘ averages both the input and the output density.
  
* 'RHOPOS' turns on a switch that forces the density positive at all points

{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

##### _VERS_
This category is used for version control. As of version 7, the input file must have following tokens for any program in the suite:

    VERS LM:7

It tells the input system that you have a v7 style input file.  

For a particular program you need an additional token to tell the parser that this file is set up for that program.
Thus your VERS category should read:

~~~

VERS LM:7 ASA:7              for lm, lmgf or lmpg
VERS LM:7 FP:7               for lmf or lmfgwd
VERS LM:7 MOL:3              for a molecules codes such as lmmc
VERS LM:7 TB:9               for the empirical tight-binding tbe
                             and so on.

~~~

Add version control tokens for whatever programs your input file is capable of handling.
