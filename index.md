Welcome to the Questaal website.   

This site serves as the primary web source for information on Questaal - the suite of density functional tools based on the linear muffin tin orbital approach. Please see our [About Page](/about/) or the Functionality tab for more information on the codes.  

You should begin by visiting the [installation tutorial](/install/) to get the suite up and running. Once you have done this, have a look at the Functionality tab for what the code can do and the Tutorials tab for how to do them.

If you have any questions or comments, you can find our contact details on the [Contact Page](/contact/).
